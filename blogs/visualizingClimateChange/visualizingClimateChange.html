    <h1>Visualizing climate change using Azure Notebooks</h1>
    <a><img src="./images/azureNotebooks.png"></a>
    <h2>A bit of a background</h2>
    <p>In today’s blog I will be sharing my experience of using Azure/Jupyter notebooks to visualize climate data. But
        what exactly is a Jupyter notebook?</p>
    <p>“A Jupyter/Azure Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that
        contain
        live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text”. In practice what this allows is to be able to run code
        online and at the same time have normal text and document type attachments alongside it. This is very convenient
        for all types of enthusiasts and professionals alike.</p>
    <h2>Excited to dive into it? Let’s go!</h2>
    <p>Do you think it takes an expert to go through all this? Well let’s just say that in less than 45’ you can become
        an expert yourself.</p>
    <h2>1. First things first: Setting up:</h2>
    <p>All we need to set up is a Microsoft account so if you do not have one please create one to proceed. You can do
        so at: <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/account">"https://account.microsoft.com/account"</a>. Having that
        set up all you need to do now is to log
        into Azure Notebooks <a href="https://notebooks.azure.com">"https://notebooks.azure.com"</a>.
        <br></br>
        Finally you also need to download the resource files that we are going to be using. You can do so by downloading
        the zip file <a href="https://a4r.blob.core.windows.net/public/notebook-resources.zip">here</a>
    </p>
    <h2>2. The lab experience: Put on your lab coats and get to work!:</h2>
    <h3>2.1: Setting up the notebook:</h3>
    <p>The lab in itself was fairly short and self-explanatory in its instructions so the main focus will be on the more
        interesting, discussion-friendly bits.
        <br></br>
        After we set up our Notebook as instructed we select our programming language as Python 3.5.
        <br></br>
        Python is what we call a high-level programming language and its main advantage is that it has quite a natural
        syntax writing (the equivalent of grammar in programming). Hence this makes it quite easy to understand
        especially for someone with no programming experience.</p>
    <a><img src="images/image1.png"></a>
    <h3>2.2: The Code</h3>
    <p>As in everything in real life when we want to build something, we need our toolbox. In programming those our
        called libraries. Libraries provide certain functions (our tools if you like) in order to make the process of
        achieving our goal easier. As such we don’t have to reinvent the wheel!
        <br></br>
        Hence we start of by importing the libraries we will be using in this laboratory.</p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-py"><code>
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    import seaborn as sns; sns.set()
    </code></pre>
    <p>
        These are:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Matplotlib.pyplot</b>: used to create axis and in general plot data in different formats and curve
                fitting
            </li>
            <li><b>Numpy</b>: numpy is a very standard library used in python. It is used for numerically manipulating
                large
                sets of number. It is very efficient and thus preferred</li>
            <li><b>Sklearn</b>: This library provides simple tools for data mining and data analysis via the use of
                machine
                learning</li>
            <li><b>Seaborn</b>: This is based upon matplotlib and it provides a high-level interface for drawing
                attractive
                statistical graphics.</li>
        </ul>
        After importing the .csv files we proceed on creating a scatter plot of the data using the simple functions
        provided by the matplotlib library.
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-py"><code>
    #Import Data
    yearsBase, meanBase = np.loadtxt('5-year-mean-1951-1980.csv', delimiter=',', usecols=(0, 1), unpack=True)
    years, mean = np.loadtxt('5-year-mean-1882-2014.csv', delimiter=',', usecols=(0, 1), unpack=True)
    </code></pre>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-py"><code>
    #Create a Scatter plot
    plt.scatter(yearsBase, meanBase)
    plt.title('scatter plot of mean temp difference vs year')
    plt.xlabel('years', fontsize=12)
    plt.ylabel('mean temp difference', fontsize=12);
    plt.show()
    </code></pre>
    <a><img src="images/image3.png"></a>
    <p>Now that we have our scatter plot we need to analyse the data. A very useful property used extensively for
        predictive modelling is that of curve fitting. This is a method by which we try and identify a trend matching a
        specific profile. In this lab we are implementing a linear regression fit in three different ways.</p>
    <h4>Method 1: Matplotlib</h4>
    <p>This method uses the matplotlib library to fit a line on the scatter plot data. This is done by first calling
        the polyfit() function which fits a polynomial curve (here is 1 as specified in the parameter) to the data.
        Also, in order to draw the line seen on the plot we do have to declare a separate “line function”.
    </p>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-py"><code>
    # Creates a linear regression from the data points
    m,b = np.polyfit(yearsBase, meanBase, 1)
    
    # This is a simple y = mx + b line function
    def f(x):
        return m*x + b
    
    # This generates the same scatter plot as before, but adds a line plot using the function above
    plt.scatter(yearsBase, meanBase)
    plt.plot(yearsBase, f(yearsBase))
    plt.title('scatter plot of mean temp difference vs year')
    plt.xlabel('years', fontsize=12)
    plt.ylabel('mean temp difference', fontsize=12);
    plt.show()
    
    # Prints text to the screen showing the computed values of m and b
    print(' y = {0} * x + {1}'.format(m, b))
    plt.show()
    </code></pre>
    <p>Hence, we can see how matplotlib data fitting can be used in generally simple cases rather than very complex
        ones. It is still a very powerful tool to use though.
    </p>
    <a><img src="images/image2.jpg"></a>
    <h4>Method 2: Scikit-learn</h4>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-py"><code>
    # Pick the Linear Regression model and instantiate it
    model = LinearRegression(fit_intercept=True)
    
    # Fit/build the model
    model.fit(yearsBase[:, np.newaxis], meanBase)
    mean_predicted = model.predict(yearsBase[:, np.newaxis])
    
    # Generate a plot like the one in the previous exercise 
    plt.scatter(yearsBase, meanBase)
    plt.plot(yearsBase, mean_predicted)
    plt.title('scatter plot of mean temp difference vs year')
    plt.xlabel('years', fontsize=12)
    plt.ylabel('mean temp difference', fontsize=12);
    plt.show()
    
    print(' y = {0} * x + {1}'.format(model.coef_[0], model.intercept_))
    </code></pre>
    <a><img src="images/image6.jpg"></a>
    <p>The advantage of scikit-learn is that it contains different models of data fitting which are usually convenient
        to use. This is done using the power of Machine Learning which is built into the library itself.In this example
        since we wanted a linear fit we imported just the linear model. As such the code is pretty simple comprising of
        less function calls than the matplotlib example. As such one can see how scikit-learn can be applied to data
        analysis more universally and more easily than matplotlib concerning more complex case. As it was expected the
        result is exactly the same as the previous one.</p>
    <h4>Method 3: Seaborn</h4>
    <pre class="prettyprint lang-py"><code>
    plt.scatter(years, mean)
    plt.title('scatter plot of mean temp difference vs year')
    plt.xlabel('years', fontsize=12)
    plt.ylabel('mean temp difference', fontsize=12);
    sns.regplot(yearsBase, meanBase)
    plt.show()
    </code></pre>
    <a><img src="images/image9.jpg"></a>
    <p>Seaborn is an open source library specific to statistical visualization. Hence Seaborn provides very high
        performance as conveniently as possible. This can easily be seen from the little amount of code needed to do the
        same thing as on the previous two methods. A projection area was also added to show where points are expected to
        lie around this linear regression.</p>
    <h3>2.3: Presentation</h3>
    <p>An important aspect of the Microsoft Azure environment and the Microsoft philosophy is the aspect of
        collaboration. In today’s fast changing world collaboration helps us move forward. In order to reflect that
        Azure Notebooks has the functionality of converting your notebook to an easily shareable link or a presentation
        if needed. This is done very easily by clicking at the following:</p>
    <a><img src="images/image7.jpg"></a>
    <p>And then setting each cell to be either a Fragment (Code) or a Slide (Text). Clicking slideshow after having done
        that will start a slide show of your notebook. This is very convenient for professional presentation which
        involved the use of such technologies.</p>
    <h3>2.4: Sharing is Caring</h3>
    <p>
        Additionally, you can also as mentioned share the notebook with your peers and/or collaborators by clicking the
        share button at the notebooks page.

    <h2>
        3. The experience/reflection
    </h2>
    <p>
        This lab exercise was a very nice experience as it highlights the core principles we all as software enthusiasts
        and hobbyists share:
        <br></br>
        <b style="font-style:italic">Principle 1</b>: There are always many different approaches and solutions to each
        problem. This was demonstrated by
        all the different methods that we used to create the line regression for the scatter plot.


        This is a core principle as it shows that different people come up with different solutions and it the goal is
        for each one to improve and discuss with one another to find the best one.
        <br></br>
        <b style="font-style:italic">Principle 2</b>: Leading from the last principle in order to achieve the goal of
        finding the best solution there is
        a need for people to collaborate and exchange their ideas with their peers. Different people with different
        experiences think about a problem in the different way and contribute in their own unique way towards the
        solution. As such collaboration and teamwork are very crucial values for todays professional environment.
        Microsoft has been committed to that idea and encourages collaboration and the exchange of ideas through its
        ease of sharing as demonstrated in the laboratory with Azure Notebooks.
        <br></br>
        Finally, I hope that the skills cultivated in this lab gave you the eagerness to explore more in the world of
        machine learning and Python programming as the applications are endless. As such here are some interesting
        projects to undergo:
        <br></br>
        <b style="font-style:italic">Suggested Project 1:</b>
        Create a model to predict the trend of a stock price over a month and compare the performance of different
        models.
        <br></br>
        <b style="font-style:italic">Suggested Project 2:</b>
        Create a Jupyter Notebook application to investigate how population is changing over the years in developed v
        developing countries.
        <br></br>
